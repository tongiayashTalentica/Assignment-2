# TASK-009: Advanced Undo/Redo History System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive undo/redo system with minimum 50-step history using the command pattern. This system tracks all user actions, provides keyboard shortcuts, and ensures efficient memory management while maintaining application performance.

## Priority
**HIGH** - Advanced feature required for professional editing experience

## Estimated Duration
**5-6 days**

## Main Task Description
Create a robust command pattern-based undo/redo system that tracks component creation, modification, movement, and deletion with efficient state snapshots, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y), and memory optimization for 50+ history steps.

## Subtasks

### 9.1 Command Pattern Architecture
- Design base Command interface with execute/undo/redo methods
- Create specific command classes for each user action type
- Implement command factory for consistent command creation
- Design command composition for complex operations
- Create command validation and constraint checking

### 9.2 History Management System
- Implement history stack with configurable size (50+ steps)
- Create efficient state snapshot system
- Design history navigation (undo/redo) functionality
- Implement history pruning and memory management
- Create history persistence integration

### 9.3 Action Command Implementations
- **AddComponentCommand**: Track component creation from palette
- **MoveComponentCommand**: Track component position changes
- **UpdatePropertyCommand**: Track component property modifications
- **DeleteComponentCommand**: Track component removal
- **SelectComponentCommand**: Track component selection changes (optional)

### 9.4 State Snapshot System
- Implement efficient canvas state snapshots
- Create incremental state diffing for memory optimization
- Design state restoration mechanisms
- Implement snapshot compression for large states
- Create snapshot validation and integrity checking

### 9.5 Keyboard Shortcuts Integration
- Implement global keyboard event listeners
- Create cross-platform shortcut handling (Ctrl+Z/Cmd+Z)
- Design keyboard shortcut conflict resolution
- Implement shortcut customization system (future enhancement)
- Create accessibility-compliant keyboard navigation

### 9.6 Memory Management & Performance
- Implement history size limits and automatic pruning
- Create memory usage monitoring for history system
- Design efficient state storage and retrieval
- Implement lazy loading for old history entries
- Create performance benchmarks for history operations

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **Command Pattern Tests**: Test all command implementations and execution
- **History Stack Tests**: Test history navigation and management
- **State Snapshot Tests**: Test state capture and restoration accuracy
- **Memory Management Tests**: Test history pruning and memory optimization
- **Keyboard Shortcut Tests**: Test shortcut detection and handling
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark history operations for 50+ steps
- **Command Factory Tests**: Test command creation and validation
- **Integration Tests**: Test history integration with state management

### Integration Tests
- **History-State Integration**: Test history system with application state changes
- **History-UI Integration**: Test history integration with user interface actions
- **Command-Component Integration**: Test commands work with all component types

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Minimum 50 steps of undo/redo history maintained
- [ ] All user actions (create, move, modify, delete) are tracked
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y) work correctly
- [ ] State restoration is accurate and complete
- [ ] Memory usage remains optimized with history pruning
- [ ] History operations complete within performance requirements
- [ ] History integrates properly with persistence system
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all history system code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-002 (State Management), TASK-007 (Properties Panel)
- **Blocks**: None (can be integrated after core functionality is complete)

## Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK** - Complex system with memory and performance constraints

### Potential Issues
- Memory usage with 50+ state snapshots may exceed limits
- Performance degradation with large history stacks
- State snapshot accuracy and restoration complexity
- Keyboard shortcut conflicts with browser/OS shortcuts

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement incremental state diffing instead of full snapshots
- Create comprehensive performance testing and monitoring
- Design history size limits with intelligent pruning
- Use proven command pattern implementations
- Implement extensive state restoration testing

## Technical Specifications

### Command Interface
```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
  redo(): void;
  description: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  canMerge?: (other: Command) => boolean;
  merge?: (other: Command) => Command;
}

interface HistoryManager {
  executeCommand(command: Command): void;
  undo(): boolean;
  redo(): boolean;
  canUndo(): boolean;
  canRedo(): boolean;
  getHistorySize(): number;
  clearHistory(): void;
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- History operations must complete within 100ms
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB for full history
- State snapshots should be created within 50ms
- History navigation should be instantaneous (<10ms)

## Deliverables
- Complete command pattern implementation
- History management system with 50+ step capacity
- All action command implementations
- Keyboard shortcut integration
- Memory management and optimization
- Comprehensive test suite with 80% coverage
- History system documentation

## Success Metrics
- 50+ undo/redo steps maintained efficiently
- All user actions properly tracked and reversible
- Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
- History operations meet performance requirements
- 80% test coverage achieved
- Zero data loss during undo/redo operations
