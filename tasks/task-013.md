- Design manual testing procedures for each browser
- Create browser-specific bug tracking and resolution
- Implement compatibility regression testing

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **Accessibility Tests**: Test ARIA implementation and keyboard navigation
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Test functionality across all supported browsers
- **Keyboard Navigation Tests**: Test complete keyboard operation
- **Screen Reader Tests**: Test screen reader compatibility and announcements
- **Mobile Compatibility Tests**: Test mobile and tablet functionality
- **Color Contrast Tests**: Test color contrast compliance
- **Focus Management Tests**: Test focus indicators and management

### Integration Tests
- **Accessibility Integration**: Test accessibility across complete user workflows
- **Cross-Browser Integration**: Test complete application functionality per browser
- **Mobile Integration**: Test mobile user experience and functionality

### End-to-End Tests
- **Accessibility E2E**: Test complete accessibility compliance in real usage
- **Cross-Browser E2E**: Test full application functionality across all browsers
- **Mobile E2E**: Test complete mobile user experience
