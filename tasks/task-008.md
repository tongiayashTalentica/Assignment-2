# TASK-008: localStorage Persistence System

## Overview
Implement the complete data persistence system using browser localStorage as the sole database. This system handles project storage, auto-save functionality, data serialization, version control, and storage capacity management within the 5-10MB browser limit.

## Priority
**HIGH** - Critical for data persistence and user experience

## Estimated Duration
**4-5 days**

## Main Task Description
Create a robust localStorage-based persistence system that handles project data storage, auto-save every 30 seconds, version control for schema migrations, storage capacity monitoring, and data compression while ensuring data integrity and recovery capabilities.

## Subtasks

### 8.1 Storage Schema Design
- Design comprehensive storage schema with versioning
- Create project data structure with metadata
- Implement user settings and preferences storage
- Design storage usage tracking and monitoring
- Create schema migration system for future updates

### 8.2 Data Serialization System
- Implement JSON serialization for complex state objects
- Create data compression for large projects
- Design error handling for serialization failures
- Implement data integrity validation
- Create backup and recovery mechanisms

### 8.3 Project Management System
- Implement multiple project storage and management
- Create project metadata (name, description, timestamps)
- Design project thumbnail generation and storage
- Implement project import/export functionality
- Create project deletion and cleanup

### 8.4 Auto-Save Implementation
- Implement automatic saving every 30 seconds
- Create save state tracking and user feedback
- Design save conflict resolution
- Implement save failure handling and retry logic
- Create manual save functionality

### 8.5 Storage Capacity Management
- Implement real-time storage usage monitoring
- Create automatic cleanup when approaching limits
- Design storage quota warning system
- Implement oldest-first deletion strategy
- Create storage optimization recommendations

### 8.6 Data Recovery & Backup
- Implement crash recovery mechanisms
- Create data validation and corruption detection
- Design rollback functionality for failed saves
- Implement export/import for backup purposes
- Create data migration utilities

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **Serialization Tests**: Test JSON serialization/deserialization accuracy
- **Storage Operations Tests**: Test all localStorage CRUD operations
- **Version Control Tests**: Test schema migration and version compatibility
- **Auto-Save Tests**: Test automatic saving functionality and timing
- **Capacity Management Tests**: Test storage monitoring and cleanup
- **Data Validation Tests**: Test data integrity and corruption detection
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test recovery from storage failures

### Integration Tests
- **State-Storage Integration**: Test complete save/load cycles with application state
- **Project Management Integration**: Test project operations with storage system
- **Auto-Save Integration**: Test auto-save with real application usage patterns

### Test Files to Create

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Projects save and load correctly with all data intact
- [ ] Auto-save functions every 30 seconds without user interruption
- [ ] Storage capacity is monitored and managed properly
- [ ] Data serialization handles all component types and properties
- [ ] Version control enables schema migrations
- [ ] Storage errors are handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Multiple projects can be stored and managed
- [ ] Data recovery works after browser crashes or failures
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all persistence code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-002 (State Management), TASK-003 (Component System)
- **Blocks**: None (can run in parallel with UI development)

## Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM RISK** - Storage limitations and data integrity challenges

### Potential Issues
- 5-10MB storage limit may be restrictive for complex projects
- Data corruption from interrupted saves
- Browser localStorage clearing by user or system
- Serialization failures with complex state objects

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement data compression to maximize storage efficiency
- Create robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Design incremental save strategies
- Implement data validation at multiple levels
- Create export functionality for external backups

## Technical Specifications

### Storage Schema
```typescript
interface StorageSchema {
  version: string;
  projects: {
    [projectId: string]: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      description: string;
      canvas: CanvasSnapshot;
      createdAt: string;
      updatedAt: string;
      thumbnail?: string;
    };
  };
  settings: UserSettings;
  metadata: {
    storageUsage: number;
    lastCleanup: string;
    totalProjects: number;
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- Save operations must complete within 200ms
- Load operations must complete within 300ms
- Storage monitoring should not impact application performance
- Auto-save should not interrupt user interactions

## Deliverables
- Complete localStorage persistence system
- Project management functionality
- Auto-save implementation
- Storage capacity management
- Data recovery and backup systems
- Comprehensive test suite with 80% coverage
- Persistence system documentation
