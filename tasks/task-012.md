## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All interactions complete within sub-100ms response time requirement
- [ ] Drag operations maintain consistent 60 FPS performance
- [ ] Memory usage stays within 100MB operational limit
- [ ] All user inputs are properly sanitized and validated
- [ ] XSS prevention measures block malicious input
- [ ] CSP headers prevent unauthorized script execution
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides real-time metrics
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented and detected
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all optimization and security code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: All previous tasks (optimization and security are applied across the entire application)
- **Blocks**: None (final optimization and security layer)

## Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM-HIGH RISK** - Performance targets are ambitious and security is critical

### Potential Issues
- Sub-100ms response time may be difficult to achieve consistently
- 60 FPS during drag operations may require significant optimization
- Complex security implementation may impact performance
- Memory management complexity with large applications

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement performance monitoring from the start
- Create comprehensive benchmarking and testing
- Use proven optimization techniques and patterns
- Design security measures with performance in mind
- Implement gradual optimization and measurement
