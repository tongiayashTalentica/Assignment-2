# TASK-001: Project Foundation & Development Environment Setup

## Overview
Initialize the complete development environment and project foundation for the Aura No-Code Visual Content Editor. This task establishes the core infrastructure, build system, and basic application shell required for all subsequent development.

## Priority
**HIGH** - Foundation task that blocks all other development

## Estimated Duration
**3-4 days**

## Main Task Description
Set up React 18+ with TypeScript project structure, configure modern build tooling, establish state management foundation, implement styling system, and create the basic three-panel layout shell that will house all application functionality.

## Subtasks

### 1.1 React 18+ TypeScript Project Initialization
- Initialize new React 18+ project with TypeScript support
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode and proper type checking
- Set up project directory structure following best practices
- Configure package.json with all required dependencies
- Ensure React 18 concurrent features are properly configured

### 1.2 Vite Build System Configuration
- Configure Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- Set up Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant development feedback
- Configure build optimization settings (tree shaking, code splitting)
- Set up environment variable handling
- Configure asset optimization and compression

### 1.3 Zustand State Management Setup
- Install and configure Zustand for lightweight state management
- Create initial store structure with TypeScript interfaces
- Set up Redux DevTools integration for debugging
- Implement basic state persistence patterns
- Create state management utilities and helpers

### 1.4 CSS Modules & PostCSS Configuration
- Configure CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- Set up PostCSS with autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility
- Create base CSS variables and design tokens
- Set up CSS optimization for production builds
- Configure CSS linting and formatting rules

### 1.5 Development Tooling Setup
- Configure ESLint with TypeScript and React rules
- Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Configure pre-commit hooks with Husky and lint-staged
- Set up VS Code workspace settings and extensions
- Configure debugging settings for development

### 1.6 Testing Framework Foundation
- Install and configure Jest for unit testing
- Set up React Testing Library for component testing
- Configure test coverage reporting with 80% target
- Set up test utilities and custom render functions
- Create testing configuration for TypeScript

### 1.7 Basic Three-Panel Layout Shell
- Create main application container component
- Implement responsive three-panel layout (20%-60%-20%)
- Set up basic routing structure if needed
- Create panel container components (Palette, Canvas, Properties)
- Implement basic responsive behavior for mobile devices

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **Build Configuration Tests**: Validate Vite configuration, TypeScript setup, and build outputs
- **Component Rendering Tests**: Test basic layout components render correctly
- **State Management Tests**: Test initial store setup and basic state operations
- **Utility Function Tests**: Test helper functions and configuration utilities
- **CSS Module Tests**: Validate CSS module imports and scoping
- **Environment Setup Tests**: Test development and production environment configurations

### Integration Tests
- **Build Process Integration**: Test complete build pipeline from source to output
- **Development Server Integration**: Test HMR and development server functionality
- **State-Component Integration**: Test basic state management integration with React components

### Test Files to Create
```

├── build-config.test.ts
├── environment.test.ts
├── state-setup.test.ts
└── layout-shell.test.tsx

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React 18+ project successfully initializes with TypeScript
- [ ] Vite build system compiles and serves application correctly
- [ ] Zustand store is configured and accessible throughout application
- [ ] CSS Modules work correctly with component styling
- [ ] All development tools (ESLint, Prettier, testing) are functional
- [ ] Three-panel layout renders correctly on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all setup and configuration code
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Production build generates optimized assets

## Dependencies
- **Blocks**: All other tasks depend on this foundation
- **External Dependencies**: Node.js 16+, modern browser for testing

## Risk Assessment
**LOW RISK** - Well-established technologies with extensive documentation

### Potential Issues
- Version compatibility between React 18 and other dependencies
- TypeScript configuration complexity
- CSS Modules integration challenges

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use exact version pinning for critical dependencies
- Follow official documentation for all configurations
- Create comprehensive setup documentation

## Deliverables
- Fully configured development environment
- Working three-panel layout shell
- Complete test suite with 80% coverage
- Documentation for setup and development processes
- CI/CD pipeline foundation (if applicable)

## Success Metrics
- Development server starts in under 10 seconds
- Build process completes in under 60 seconds
- All tests pass with 80% coverage
- No linting errors in codebase
- Layout responsive on all target screen sizes
