# TASK-004: Custom Drag-and-Drop Implementation (HIGH RISK)

## Overview
Implement a custom, native browser event-based drag-and-drop system that supports both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) interactions. This is the most technically challenging task as it cannot use any comprehensive drag-and-drop libraries and must maintain 60 FPS performance during drag operations.

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Core interaction mechanism for the entire editor

## Estimated Duration
**7-8 days** (includes extensive testing and cross-browser validation)

## Main Task Description
Build a state machine-driven drag-and-drop system using only native browser events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, touchstart, touchmove, touchend) that supports dragging components from the palette to canvas and moving components within the canvas, while maintaining smooth 60 FPS performance across all supported browsers.

## Subtasks

### 4.1 Drag State Machine Design
- Design comprehensive drag state enumeration (IDLE, DRAGGING_FROM_PALETTE, DRAGGING_CANVAS_COMPONENT)
- Create DragContext interface for tracking drag operations
- Implement state transitions and validation logic
- Design drag operation lifecycle management
- Create drag cancellation and cleanup mechanisms

### 4.2 Native Event System Implementation
- Implement unified mouse event handling (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup)
- Implement unified touch event handling (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- Create cross-platform event normalization layer
- Implement event delegation for performance optimization
- Design event listener management and cleanup

### 4.3 Drag Initiation System
- Implement drag detection with minimum distance threshold
- Create visual drag feedback (ghost element, cursor changes)
- Design drag data payload management
- Implement drag source identification and validation
- Create drag permission and constraint checking

### 4.4 Palette-to-Canvas Drag Implementation
- Implement component dragging from palette
- Create canvas drop zone detection and validation
- Design component instantiation at drop coordinates
- Implement visual feedback during palette drag operations
- Create boundary constraint validation for canvas drops

### 4.5 Canvas Component Movement
- Implement canvas component selection for dragging
- Create component position tracking during drag
- Design collision detection with canvas boundaries
- Implement snap-to-grid functionality (optional enhancement)
- Create visual feedback for component movement

### 4.6 Performance Optimization
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60 FPS animations
- Create event throttling for mousemove/touchmove events
- Design efficient DOM manipulation during drag operations
- Implement GPU-accelerated transforms for movement
- Create memory management for drag operations

### 4.7 Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Test and fix drag behavior across Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- Implement browser-specific event handling quirks
- Create fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
- Design progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Test mobile browser compatibility (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### 4.8 Touch Device Optimization
- Implement touch-specific drag behaviors
- Create touch gesture conflict resolution
- Design mobile-optimized drag feedback
- Implement touch accessibility features
- Test across various mobile devices and screen sizes

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **State Machine Tests**: Test all drag state transitions and validations
- **Event Handler Tests**: Test mouse and touch event processing
- **Event Normalization Tests**: Test cross-platform event abstraction
- **Drag Context Tests**: Test drag context creation and management
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark drag operation performance (60 FPS requirement)
- **Boundary Validation Tests**: Test canvas boundary constraint checking
- **Component Creation Tests**: Test component instantiation from palette drags
- **Position Calculation Tests**: Test coordinate transformation and positioning

### Integration Tests
- **Complete Drag Workflows**: Test full drag-and-drop user interactions
- **Cross-Device Integration**: Test drag behavior consistency across devices
- **State-Drag Integration**: Test drag operations with state management
- **Component-Drag Integration**: Test drag integration with component system

### End-to-End Tests
- **Cross-Browser E2E**: Test complete drag workflows across all supported browsers
- **Performance Validation**: Test 60 FPS maintenance during complex drag operations
- **Mobile Device Testing**: Test touch drag functionality on actual mobile devices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works smoothly on all supported desktop browsers
- [ ] Touch drag functionality works on mobile devices and tablets
- [ ] Drag operations maintain 60 FPS performance during movement
- [ ] Components can be dragged from palette to canvas successfully
- [ ] Canvas components can be moved within canvas boundaries
- [ ] Visual feedback is clear and responsive during all drag operations
- [ ] Drag operations integrate properly with state management
- [ ] Event listeners are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility is verified and consistent
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all drag-and-drop code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-001 (Project Foundation), TASK-002 (State Management), TASK-003 (Component System)
- **Blocks**: TASK-005 (Component Palette), TASK-006 (Canvas Workspace)

## Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK** - Most complex technical implementation with strict performance requirements

### Major Risk Factors
- Cross-browser event handling inconsistencies
- Touch/mouse event compatibility challenges
- Performance degradation with complex drag operations
- Memory leaks from event listener management
- Mobile browser gesture conflicts
- Maintaining 60 FPS during drag operations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Create comprehensive cross-browser testing suite early
- Implement progressive enhancement approach
- Build performance monitoring into drag operations
- Create extensive unit tests for event handling
- Implement proof-of-concept early for validation
- Design fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers
- Use established patterns for event delegation and cleanup

## Technical Specifications

### Drag State Machine
```typescript
enum DragState {
  IDLE = 'idle',
  DRAGGING_FROM_PALETTE = 'dragging_from_palette',
  DRAGGING_CANVAS_COMPONENT = 'dragging_canvas_component',
  DRAG_ENDING = 'drag_ending'
}

interface DragContext {
  state: DragState;
  draggedComponent: ComponentType | BaseComponent | null;
  startPosition: { x: number; y: number };
  currentPosition: { x: number; y: number };
  targetElement: HTMLElement | null;
  dragOffset: { x: number; y: number };
  isDragValid: boolean;
}
```

### Event Handling Interface
```typescript
interface DragEventHandler {
  handleDragStart(event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent): void;
  handleDragMove(event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent): void;
  handleDragEnd(event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent): void;
  normalizeEvent(event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent): NormalizedDragEvent;
  cleanup(): void;
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- Drag operations must maintain 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame)
- Event handler execution must complete within 5ms
- Memory usage should not increase during drag operations
- DOM manipulations must use GPU-accelerated transforms

## Deliverables
- Complete custom drag-and-drop system
- Cross-platform event handling layer
- Performance-optimized drag animations
- Comprehensive test suite with 80% coverage
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Mobile device testing results
- Performance benchmarking documentation
- Drag-and-drop system documentation

## Success Metrics
- 60 FPS maintained during all drag operations
- Drag functionality works identically across all supported browsers
- Touch drag works smoothly on mobile devices
- Zero memory leaks from event listener management
- Sub-5ms event handler execution times
- 80% test coverage achieved
- All drag workflows complete successfully in E2E tests

## Proof of Concept Requirements
**MANDATORY**: A working proof-of-concept must be completed by day 3 of this task to validate the technical approach before full implementation. The PoC should demonstrate:
- Basic mouse drag functionality
- Touch drag functionality
- 60 FPS performance measurement
- Cross-browser basic compatibility
- Integration with state management

If the PoC reveals insurmountable technical challenges, this task must be escalated for requirement review.
