# TASK-006: Canvas Workspace Implementation

## Overview
Implement the main editing environment where users interact with components. The canvas serves as the 60% center panel where components are positioned, selected, and manipulated with real-time visual feedback and sub-100ms performance.

## Priority
**HIGH** - Core editing interface for all user interactions

## Estimated Duration
**6-7 days**

## Main Task Description
Create a responsive, high-performance canvas workspace that supports component positioning, selection, manipulation, boundary constraints, and visual feedback while maintaining sub-100ms response times for all interactions.

## Subtasks

### 6.1 Canvas Layout & Rendering System
- Implement responsive canvas container within 60% width constraint
- Create absolute positioning system for components
- Design canvas grid system (optional visual aid)
- Implement zoom and pan functionality (future enhancement)
- Create canvas boundary management and constraints

### 6.2 Component Selection System
- Implement click-to-select functionality for components
- Create visual selection indicators (borders, handles)
- Design multi-component selection (future enhancement foundation)
- Implement selection state management and persistence
- Create keyboard selection navigation

### 6.3 Component Manipulation Interface
- Integrate with drag-and-drop system for component movement
- Implement component resizing handles (for Image components)
- Create component rotation controls (future enhancement)
- Design component duplication and deletion
- Implement component layering (z-index) management

### 6.4 Visual Feedback System
- Create hover states for all interactive elements
- Implement real-time component property updates
- Design visual guides for alignment and spacing
- Create component boundary and collision indicators
- Implement performance-optimized rendering updates

### 6.5 Canvas State Management
- Integrate with application state for component data
- Implement canvas viewport state (dimensions, scroll position)
- Create component selection state synchronization
- Design canvas operation history tracking
- Manage canvas performance metrics and monitoring

### 6.6 Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient component rendering with React.memo
- Create viewport-based rendering optimization
- Design requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement event delegation for canvas interactions
- Create memory management for large component counts

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **Canvas Rendering Tests**: Test canvas layout and component positioning
- **Selection System Tests**: Test component selection and visual feedback
- **Manipulation Tests**: Test component movement and manipulation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark sub-100ms response time requirements
- **State Management Tests**: Test canvas state synchronization
- **Boundary Tests**: Test canvas constraint validation
- **Visual Feedback Tests**: Test hover states and visual indicators

### Integration Tests
- **Canvas-Drag Integration**: Test canvas integration with drag-and-drop
- **Canvas-State Integration**: Test canvas synchronization with application state
- **Canvas-Component Integration**: Test canvas interaction with component system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Canvas renders within 60% width constraint responsively
- [ ] Component selection works with clear visual feedback
- [ ] Component manipulation completes within sub-100ms requirement
- [ ] Canvas integrates seamlessly with drag-and-drop system
- [ ] Boundary constraints prevent components from leaving canvas
- [ ] Visual feedback is responsive and performance-optimized
- [ ] Canvas state synchronizes properly with application state
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all canvas code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-003 (Component System), TASK-004 (Drag-and-Drop)
- **Blocks**: TASK-007 (Properties Panel)

## Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM RISK** - Performance-critical UI with complex interactions

## Deliverables
- Complete canvas workspace implementation
- Component selection and manipulation system
- Visual feedback and performance optimization
- Canvas state management integration
- Comprehensive test suite with 80% coverage
