# TASK-002: Core State Management Architecture

## Overview
Design and implement the centralized state management system using Zustand that will serve as the backbone for all application data flow. This includes canvas state, UI state, history management, and persistence layer integration.

## Priority
**HIGH** - Critical foundation for all interactive features

## Estimated Duration
**4-5 days**

## Main Task Description
Create a robust, immutable state management architecture that handles all application state including component data, UI interactions, drag-and-drop states, and provides the foundation for undo/redo functionality while maintaining sub-100ms performance requirements.

## Subtasks

### 2.1 Application State Structure Design
- Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all state categories
- Create canvas state structure (components, selection, dimensions)
- Design UI state structure (drag context, active panels, preview modes)
- Plan history state structure for undo/redo (past, present, future)
- Design persistence state structure for localStorage integration

### 2.2 Zustand Store Implementation
- Implement main application store with proper TypeScript typing
- Create state slices for different application domains
- Set up immutable state update patterns using Immer integration
- Implement state subscription and selector patterns
- Configure Redux DevTools integration for debugging

### 2.3 Component State Management
- Create component collection management (Map-based storage)
- Implement component CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Design component selection and focus state management
- Create component property update mechanisms
- Implement component validation and constraint checking

### 2.4 Canvas State Management
- Implement canvas dimensions and viewport management
- Create component positioning and z-index management
- Design boundary constraint validation
- Implement multi-component selection (future enhancement foundation)
- Create canvas-level state persistence

### 2.5 UI State Management
- Implement drag-and-drop context state management
- Create panel visibility and active state management
- Design modal and overlay state management
- Implement preview mode state management
- Create UI preference and settings management

### 2.6 State Persistence Integration
- Design localStorage integration patterns
- Implement state serialization and deserialization
- Create state migration system for version compatibility
- Design auto-save state management
- Implement state restoration and error recovery

### 2.7 Performance Optimization
- Implement selective state subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Create state update batching mechanisms
- Design efficient state comparison and diffing
- Implement memory management for large state objects
- Create performance monitoring for state operations

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **State Structure Tests**: Validate all TypeScript interfaces and state shapes
- **Store Operations Tests**: Test all CRUD operations for components and state
- **Immutability Tests**: Verify all state updates maintain immutability
- **Selector Tests**: Test state selectors and derived state calculations
- **Validation Tests**: Test component validation and constraint checking
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark state update performance (<100ms requirement)
- **Persistence Tests**: Test serialization/deserialization accuracy
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test state recovery and error scenarios

### Integration Tests
- **Store-Component Integration**: Test state changes trigger proper component updates
- **Multi-Store Integration**: Test interaction between different state slices
- **Persistence Integration**: Test complete save/load cycles with localStorage

### End-to-End Tests
- **Complete State Workflows**: Test full user interaction flows through state system
- **Performance Validation**: Test state performance under realistic load conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All state interfaces properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Zustand store handles all application state categories
- [ ] Immutable state updates work correctly throughout application
- [ ] State persistence to localStorage functions properly
- [ ] Component CRUD operations complete within performance requirements
- [ ] State selectors provide efficient derived state access
- [ ] Redux DevTools integration works for debugging
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all state management code
- [ ] State updates trigger appropriate component re-renders
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms function correctly

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-001 (Project Foundation)
- **Blocks**: TASK-003 (Component System), TASK-004 (Drag-and-Drop)

## Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM RISK** - Complex state management with performance requirements

### Potential Issues
- State update performance may not meet <100ms requirement
- Complex state relationships could cause update cascades
- Immutability patterns may be difficult to maintain consistently
- localStorage integration complexity with large state objects

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement performance monitoring from the start
- Use proven immutability libraries (Immer) rather than manual patterns
- Create comprehensive test suite for state operations
- Design state structure to minimize update cascades
- Implement state size monitoring for localStorage limits

## Technical Specifications

### State Structure Example
```typescript
interface ApplicationState {
  canvas: {
    components: Map<string, BaseComponent>;
    selectedComponentId: string | null;
    dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
    zoom: number;
  };
  ui: {
    dragContext: DragContext;
    activePanel: PanelType;
    previewMode: PreviewMode;
    modals: ModalState;
  };
  history: {
    past: CanvasSnapshot[];
    present: CanvasSnapshot;
    future: CanvasSnapshot[];
    maxHistorySize: number;
  };
  persistence: {
    currentProject: Project | null;
    isDirty: boolean;
    lastSaved: Date | null;
    autoSaveEnabled: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- State updates must complete within 100ms
- Memory usage should not exceed 100MB for typical projects
- State serialization should complete within 50ms
- Component updates should not cause unnecessary re-renders
