# TASK-011: Responsive Preview System

## Overview
Implement a responsive preview system that allows users to view their designs in desktop and mobile viewports, generate clean HTML/CSS code, and export the final design. This system provides accurate rendering simulation and code generation capabilities.

## Priority
**MEDIUM** - Advanced feature for design validation and export

## Estimated Duration
**4-5 days**

## Main Task Description
Create a comprehensive preview system that simulates different device viewports, generates semantic HTML and responsive CSS, provides accurate design rendering, and enables code export functionality while maintaining performance and accuracy.

## Subtasks

### 11.1 Viewport Simulation System
- Implement desktop viewport simulation (1200px+ standard)
- Create mobile viewport simulation (375px standard)
- Design viewport switching with smooth transitions
- Implement zoom and scale controls for preview
- Create responsive breakpoint visualization

### 11.2 Preview Mode Implementation
- Create preview mode toggle functionality
- Design preview container with device frames
- Implement preview state management
- Create preview navigation and controls
- Design preview mode exit functionality

### 11.3 HTML Generation Engine
- Implement semantic HTML structure generation
- Create component-to-HTML mapping system
- Design clean, accessible HTML output
- Implement proper HTML validation
- Create HTML structure optimization

### 11.4 CSS Generation System
- Generate responsive CSS for all component types
- Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox layout generation
- Create component-specific CSS rules
- Design CSS optimization and minification
- Implement cross-browser CSS compatibility

### 11.5 Responsive Behavior Implementation
- Create responsive design rules for components
- Implement mobile-first CSS approach
- Design breakpoint-based styling
- Create responsive typography scaling
- Implement responsive spacing and layout

### 11.6 Export Functionality
- Implement HTML/CSS code export
- Create downloadable file generation
- Design export format options (HTML, CSS, ZIP)
- Implement code formatting and beautification
- Create export preview and validation

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **Viewport Simulation Tests**: Test desktop and mobile viewport rendering
- **HTML Generation Tests**: Test HTML output accuracy for all component types
- **CSS Generation Tests**: Test CSS rule generation and optimization
- **Preview Mode Tests**: Test preview mode activation and functionality
- **Responsive Tests**: Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
- **Export Tests**: Test code export functionality and file generation
- **Performance Tests**: Test preview rendering performance

### Integration Tests
- **Preview-Component Integration**: Test preview system with all component types
- **Preview-State Integration**: Test preview synchronization with application state
- **Export Integration**: Test complete export workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Desktop and mobile preview modes render accurately
- [ ] Generated HTML is semantic and accessible
- [ ] Generated CSS is responsive and cross-browser compatible
- [ ] Preview mode transitions are smooth and performant
- [ ] Export functionality generates working HTML/CSS files
- [ ] Responsive behavior matches preview expectations
- [ ] Preview system integrates properly with application state
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all preview system code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-003 (Component System), TASK-006 (Canvas Workspace)
- **Blocks**: None (can be developed independently)

## Risk Assessment
**LOW-MEDIUM RISK** - Well-defined functionality with established patterns

### Potential Issues
- CSS generation complexity for all component types
- Responsive behavior accuracy across different devices
- HTML output validation and accessibility compliance
- Export file generation and browser compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use established CSS generation patterns
- Test responsive behavior on actual devices
- Implement HTML validation and accessibility checking
- Create comprehensive export testing suite

## Technical Specifications

### Preview System Interface
```typescript
interface PreviewSystem {
  setViewport(type: 'desktop' | 'mobile'): void;
  generateHTML(): string;
  generateCSS(): string;
  exportProject(format: 'html' | 'css' | 'zip'): void;
  getPreviewElement(): HTMLElement;
}

interface ViewportConfig {
  width: number;
  height: number;
  devicePixelRatio: number;
  userAgent?: string;
}
```

### HTML/CSS Generation Requirements
