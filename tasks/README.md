  - Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+ support
  - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Testing Requirements

### Overall Testing Strategy
- **70% Unit Tests** with 80% line coverage target
- **20% Integration Tests** for component interactions
- **10% End-to-End Tests** for complete user workflows

### Testing Distribution by Task
Each task includes comprehensive testing requirements:
- Unit tests targeting 80% line coverage
- Integration tests for cross-system functionality
- Performance benchmarks where applicable
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Accessibility compliance testing

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Tasks Requiring Special Attention
1. **TASK-004 (Drag-and-Drop)** - Custom implementation without libraries
2. **TASK-009 (Undo/Redo)** - Complex memory management with 50+ steps
3. **TASK-010 (Text Editor)** - ContentEditable cross-browser challenges

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Proof-of-concept development for high-risk tasks
- Comprehensive cross-browser testing suites
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking
- Progressive enhancement approaches
- Extensive unit and integration testing

## Technical Constraints

### Mandatory Requirements
- **Client-side only** - No backend services
- **Native browser events** - No comprehensive drag-and-drop libraries
- **localStorage only** - No external database
- **Performance targets** - Sub-100ms response, 60 FPS drag operations
- **Browser support** - Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+

### Prohibited Technologies
- react-dnd library
- konva.js library
- interact.js library
- GrapesJS library
- CKEditor for text editing

## Project Timeline

### Estimated Total Duration: 62-74 days (12-15 weeks)

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Weeks 1-3)
- Tasks 001-003: Core infrastructure and component system

**Phase 2: Core Interactions** (Weeks 4-8)
- Tasks 004-007: Drag-and-drop, palette, canvas, properties

**Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Weeks 9-12)
- Tasks 008-011: Persistence, history, text editor, preview

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance** (Weeks 13-15)
