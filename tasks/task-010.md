# TASK-010: Custom Inline Text Editor (HIGH RISK)

## Overview
Implement a custom contentEditable-based text editor for Text and TextArea components without using CKEditor or similar libraries. This system provides in-place text editing with basic formatting capabilities and real-time synchronization with component state.

## Priority
**HIGH** - Advanced feature for enhanced user experience

## Estimated Duration
**6-7 days** (includes extensive cross-browser testing)

## Main Task Description
Build a custom text editor using native browser contentEditable API that supports activation/deactivation, basic text formatting (bold, italic), real-time content synchronization, and cross-browser compatibility while maintaining integration with the component system.

## Subtasks

### 10.1 ContentEditable Foundation
- Implement contentEditable wrapper component
- Create text editor initialization and cleanup
- Design editor state management and lifecycle
- Implement cross-browser contentEditable normalization
- Create editor focus and blur handling

### 10.2 Activation/Deactivation System
- Implement double-click activation for Text/TextArea components
- Create programmatic activation from properties panel
- Design click-outside deactivation behavior
- Implement Escape key deactivation
- Create activation state visual feedback

### 10.3 Text Formatting System
- Implement bold formatting (Ctrl+B/Cmd+B)
- Create italic formatting (Ctrl+I/Cmd+I)
- Design formatting state tracking and synchronization
- Implement formatting button controls
- Create formatting persistence in component state

### 10.4 Content Synchronization
- Implement real-time content sync with component state
- Create content validation and sanitization
- Design change detection and debouncing
- Implement content restoration on editor errors
- Create content length limits and validation

### 10.5 Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Test and normalize behavior across Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- Implement browser-specific contentEditable quirks handling
- Create fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
- Design progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Test mobile browser compatibility

### 10.6 Keyboard Event Handling
- Implement custom keyboard shortcuts for formatting
- Create text navigation and selection handling
- Design line break and paragraph management
- Implement tab key behavior and focus management
- Create accessibility-compliant keyboard navigation

### 10.7 Integration & Performance
- Integrate with component property system
- Create performance optimization for large text content
- Implement memory management for editor instances
- Design editor cleanup and garbage collection
- Create performance monitoring for editor operations

## Testing Requirements (70% of total test effort should be Unit Tests)

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% Line Coverage)
- **ContentEditable Tests**: Test editor initialization and basic functionality
- **Activation Tests**: Test all activation and deactivation methods
- **Formatting Tests**: Test bold and italic formatting operations
- **Synchronization Tests**: Test content sync with component state
- **Keyboard Handling Tests**: Test all keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Test behavior consistency across browsers
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark editor operations and memory usage
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test recovery from contentEditable failures

### Integration Tests
- **Component Integration**: Test editor integration with Text/TextArea components
- **State Integration**: Test editor synchronization with application state
- **Properties Integration**: Test editor activation from properties panel

### End-to-End Tests
- **Complete Editing Workflows**: Test full text editing user journeys
- **Cross-Browser E2E**: Test editor functionality across all supported browsers
- **Mobile Testing**: Test touch-based text editing on mobile devices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Text editor activates on double-click for Text/TextArea components
- [ ] Editor deactivates on click outside, Escape key, or programmatically
- [ ] Bold and italic formatting work with keyboard shortcuts and buttons
- [ ] Content synchronizes in real-time with component state
- [ ] Editor works consistently across all supported browsers
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and shortcuts function correctly
- [ ] Editor performance meets application requirements
- [ ] Mobile touch editing works on tablets and phones
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 80% for all text editor code

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-003 (Component System), TASK-007 (Properties Panel)
- **Blocks**: None (advanced feature that can be added after core functionality)

## Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK** - ContentEditable has known cross-browser inconsistencies and complexity

### Major Risk Factors
- ContentEditable behavior varies significantly across browsers
- Complex text selection and cursor management
- Rich text formatting implementation challenges
- Integration complexity with React component lifecycle
- Mobile browser contentEditable limitations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Create comprehensive cross-browser testing suite early
- Implement progressive enhancement with fallbacks
- Use established contentEditable normalization techniques
- Build extensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Consider simplified text editing as fallback option
- Implement proof-of-concept early for validation

## Technical Specifications

### Text Editor Interface
```typescript
interface TextEditor {
  activate(element: HTMLElement, initialContent: string): void;
  deactivate(): void;
  getContent(): string;
  setContent(content: string): void;
  applyFormatting(format: 'bold' | 'italic'): void;
  isActive(): boolean;
  onContentChange: (content: string) => void;
}

interface EditorState {
  isActive: boolean;
  content: string;
  selection: { start: number; end: number } | null;
  formatting: { bold: boolean; italic: boolean };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- Editor activation must complete within 100ms
- Content synchronization should not cause input lag
- Formatting operations must be instantaneous
- Memory usage should remain stable with multiple editor instances

## Deliverables
- Complete custom text editor implementation
- Cross-browser compatibility layer
- Text formatting system (bold, italic)
- Content synchronization system
- Keyboard event handling
- Mobile touch editing support
- Comprehensive test suite with 80% coverage
- Text editor documentation and usage guide

## Success Metrics
- Text editing works smoothly across all supported browsers
- Content synchronization is accurate and real-time
- Formatting operations work consistently
- Mobile text editing provides good user experience
- 80% test coverage achieved
- Zero data loss during text editing operations

## Proof of Concept Requirements
**RECOMMENDED**: Build a basic proof-of-concept by day 2 to validate contentEditable approach across target browsers. If major compatibility issues are discovered, consider requesting requirement modification or implementing a simpler text input approach.
