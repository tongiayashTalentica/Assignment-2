## 2. Proposed Architectural Pattern

### 2.1 Recommended Pattern: Component-Based Architecture with Unidirectional Data Flow

**Proposed Decision:** Implement a component-based architecture following the Flux/Redux pattern with unidirectional data flow.

**Justification:**
- **Predictable State Management:** Critical for complex interactions like drag-and-drop and undo/redo
- **Component Isolation:** Each UI component (Text, Image, Button, TextArea) can be developed and tested independently
- **Performance Optimization:** Enables selective re-rendering of only affected components
- **Extensibility:** New component types can be added without modifying existing architecture
- **Debugging:** Unidirectional data flow makes state changes traceable and debuggable

**Alternative Considered:** MVC Pattern
**Why Rejected:** MVC's bidirectional data binding would create complexity in managing the canvas state, especially for undo/redo functionality where precise state snapshots are required.

**Review Questions for Stakeholders:**
1. Does this architectural pattern align with team expertise and preferences?
2. Are there concerns about React ecosystem dependencies?
3. Should we consider alternative state management approaches?

---

## 4. Critical Implementation Strategies

### 4.1 Drag-and-Drop Implementation Strategy

**Proposed Decision:** Custom implementation using native browser events with a state machine pattern

**Risk Assessment:** HIGH RISK

**Critical Constraint:** Must not use react-dnd, konva.js, interact.js, or any comprehensive drag-and-drop libraries.

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
enum DragState {
  IDLE = 'idle',
  DRAGGING_FROM_PALETTE = 'dragging_from_palette',
  DRAGGING_CANVAS_COMPONENT = 'dragging_canvas_component'
}

interface DragContext {
  state: DragState;
  draggedComponent: ComponentType | null;
  startPosition: { x: number; y: number };
  currentPosition: { x: number; y: number };
  targetElement: HTMLElement | null;
}
```

**Event Handling Strategy:**
- **Desktop:** mousedown → mousemove → mouseup
- **Mobile:** touchstart → touchmove → touchend
- **Unified Interface:** Abstract touch/mouse events into common drag events

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth drag animations
- Throttle mousemove/touchmove events to maintain 60 FPS
- Implement event delegation for canvas to minimize event listeners

**Justification:**
- **Full Control:** Complete control over drag behavior and performance
- **Cross-Platform:** Unified implementation for desktop and mobile
- **Performance:** Optimized for our specific use case
- **Compliance:** Meets the requirement for native browser events only

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Complex cross-browser event handling
- Touch/mouse event compatibility
- Performance challenges with large canvases
- Potential memory leaks with event listeners

**Mitigation Plan:**
- Create comprehensive cross-browser testing suite
- Implement progressive enhancement approach
- Build prototype early to validate approach
- Extensive performance testing and optimization

**Review Questions:**
1. Should we build a proof-of-concept first?
2. Are there fallback strategies if custom implementation fails?
3. What is the acceptable timeline for this complex feature?

### 4.2 Component System Architecture

**Proposed Decision:** Factory pattern with composition for component creation and management

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM RISK

**Component Base Structure:**
```typescript
interface BaseComponent {
  id: string;
  type: ComponentType;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
  zIndex: number;
  selected: boolean;
  properties: ComponentProperties;
}

interface ComponentFactory {
  create(type: ComponentType, position: Point): BaseComponent;
  getDefaultProperties(type: ComponentType): ComponentProperties;
}
```

**Component Type System:**
- **Text Component:** Font size, weight, color, content
- **TextArea Component:** Font size, color, text alignment, content
- **Image Component:** URL, alt text, object fit, border radius, dimensions
- **Button Component:** URL, text, font size, padding, colors, border radius

**Justification:**
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new component types
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript ensures property type correctness
- **Consistency:** Uniform interface for all component operations
- **Performance:** Efficient property validation and updates

### 4.3 State Management Strategy

**Proposed Decision:** Immutable state with command pattern for undo/redo

**Risk Assessment:** HIGH RISK

**State Structure:**
```typescript
interface ApplicationState {
  canvas: {
    components: Map<string, BaseComponent>;
    selectedComponentId: string | null;
    dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
  };
  ui: {
    dragContext: DragContext;
    activePanel: PanelType;
    previewMode: PreviewMode;
  };
  history: {
    past: CanvasSnapshot[];
    present: CanvasSnapshot;
    future: CanvasSnapshot[];
    maxHistorySize: number; // 50+ as required
  };
}
```

**Command Pattern for History:**
```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
  redo(): void;
  description: string;
}

class AddComponentCommand implements Command {
  execute() { /* Add component to canvas */ }
  undo() { /* Remove component from canvas */ }
  redo() { /* Re-add component to canvas */ }
}
```

**Justification:**
- **Undo/Redo Compliance:** Meets the 50+ step history requirement
- **Immutability:** Prevents state mutation bugs
- **Performance:** Structural sharing minimizes memory usage
- **Debugging:** Clear audit trail of all state changes

**Critical Risk Factors:**
- Complex state snapshot management
- Memory usage with 50+ history steps
- Performance impact of immutable updates
- Command pattern implementation complexity

**Review Concerns:**
1. Can we meet the 50+ step requirement within memory constraints?
2. Will immutable updates impact the sub-100ms response requirement?
3. Should we consider alternative undo/redo approaches?

### 4.4 Real-Time Property Updates

**Proposed Decision:** Debounced updates with optimistic UI

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM RISK

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Immediate UI Update:** Update canvas immediately for visual feedback
- **Debounced State Update:** Batch rapid changes to prevent performance issues
- **History Management:** Only create history entries after debounce period

**Performance Targets:**
- Property validation: <10ms
- State update: <50ms
- UI re-render: <40ms
- Total cycle: <100ms (as required)

**Justification:**
- **User Experience:** Immediate visual feedback
- **Performance:** Prevents excessive state updates
- **History Efficiency:** Reduces noise in undo/redo history

---

## 5. Data Persistence Strategy

### 5.1 localStorage Implementation

**Proposed Decision:** Structured JSON storage with versioning and compression

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM RISK

**Storage Schema:**
```typescript
interface StorageSchema {
  version: string;
  projects: {
    [projectId: string]: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      description: string;
      canvas: CanvasSnapshot;
      createdAt: string;
      updatedAt: string;
      thumbnail?: string; // Base64 encoded
    };
  };
  settings: UserSettings;
  metadata: {
    storageUsage: number;
    lastCleanup: string;
  };
}
```

**Storage Management:**
- **Capacity Monitoring:** Track usage against 5-10MB limit
- **Auto-cleanup:** Remove oldest projects when approaching limits
- **Compression:** JSON compression for large projects
- **Auto-save:** Save every 30 seconds as required

**Justification:**
- **Compliance:** Uses localStorage as the sole database as required
- **Scalability:** Handles multiple projects within storage constraints
- **Reliability:** Versioning enables future schema migrations
- **Performance:** Efficient serialization/deserialization

**Risk Considerations:**
- 5-10MB storage limit may be restrictive
- No server-side backup/sync capabilities
- Data loss risk if localStorage is cleared
- Cross-device/browser limitations
